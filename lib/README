Create two symbolic links in this directory.

The first is called 'liberated', and must point to the top of the checked-out
LIBERATED tree from git. E.g., if I have checked out LIBERATED into my home
directory, and called it 'liberated.git', I'd do this:

$ ln -s /home/derrell/liberated.git liberated

The second is called 'qooxdoo', and must point to the top of the checked-out
qooxdoo tree from git.

$ ln -s /home/derrell/qooxdoo.git qooxdoo
